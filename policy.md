Welcome to your Bonnie's mobile app! This guide will help you get the most out of all the features available to you.

## Getting Started

Once you've downloaded and logged into the app, you'll see the main dashboard with easy access to all your account features.

## Pet Management

### Adding Your Pets
1. Navigate to **My Pets** from the main dashboard
2. Tap **Add New Pet** to register a new pet
3. Fill in your pet's details:
   - Name, breed, and size
   - Special care instructions
   - Upload photos
4. Once submitted, staff will review and approve your pet profile

## Booking Services

### How Booking Works
The app uses a smart booking system with two types of availability:

**Available Slots** (Green clock icon)
- Request a booking that requires staff approval
- You'll receive a notification once approved or declined

**Pre-approved Slots** (Blue checkmark icon)  
- Book instantly without waiting for approval
- Created by staff for regular clients and recurring services

### Making a Booking
1. Choose **Book Service** from the dashboard
2. Select your desired service
3. Pick date(s) from the calendar - you can select multiple days
4. Choose which pets to include
5. Review pricing (multi-pet discounts automatically applied)
6. Confirm your booking

### Understanding Pre-approvals
Staff can pre-approve you for specific time slots to make booking faster. This works two ways:

- **Individual dates**: Pre-approved for specific days
- **Recurring patterns**: Pre-approved for regular schedules (e.g., every Monday/Wednesday)

Pre-approved bookings are confirmed instantly, while regular requests need staff approval.
